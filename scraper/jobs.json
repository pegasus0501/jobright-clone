    "description": "About Tanagram:\n\nTanagram's mission is to enable developers to work at the speed of thought. To do that, we're building a tool that captures hard-won lessons buried in codebases, code reviews, incident post-mortems, and Slack chats. We turn those lessons into real-time guardrails that flag or fix risky patterns the moment they reach a pull request \u2014 and, eventually, at code generation time \u2014 so that engineers can ship faster and avoid disaster.\n\nImagine an ideal staff engineer. They know the entire codebase and how different systems interact. They follow every PR, so they know what changes are being made and how patterns evolve. They've read all the documentation. They keep up-to-date on Slack conversations. Ultimately, they index all that information in their heads, and deliver impact by showing up everywhere and saying the right things at the right time.\n\nWe're building that, but at scale for entire teams and companies. Tanagram is an extension of every team's best staff engineer, available anywhere and anytime.\n\nAbout This Role:\n\nAs an AI Engineer Intern, you'll bridge the gap between AI research and application by using the latest research and models to build our product. Our product, so far, is almost entirely backend. We mostly build in Python, with some Swift for CPU-bound operations.\n\nWe\u2019re a small team of generalists and work across multiple domains. We're looking for meticulous, high-agency people who have the skills (or learning ability) to solve problems expediently, and an understanding of the appropriate quality bar given the surrounding business context.\n\nWe will generally work in-person in San Francisco (our office is in Mission Bay) or New York.\n\nWhat You Might Do:\n\u2022 Talk directly to users: understand their requirements, ask for their feedback, follow up as needed, and iterate based on what they say.\n\u2022 Evaluate and build with the best tools in an AI agentic stack: LLM-Evals, Guardrails for AI, CodeAct (agents writing code), memory for agents (like Mem0).\n\u2022 Build services to ingest data from places like Github, Slack, and Confluence.\n\u2022 Deploy & use reasoning models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.\n\u2022 Eagerly identify and implement improvements to our core foundations (e.g. clearing performance bottlenecks for scalability).\n\u2022 Ensure that systems are efficient, maintainable, and well-monitored.\n\nWhat We Offer:\n\u2022 Challenging work with the latest advances in LLM techniques.\n\u2022 Top-of-market compensation.\n\u2022 Computer/office equipment stipend.\n\u2022 Food stipend/reimbursements on meals.\n\u2022 Health, dental, and vision insurance.\n\u2022 Unlimited PTO.\n\u2022 A relatively un-chaotic working environment (we aren't pivoting every week).\n\u2022 An opportunity to help define our company.\n\nQualifications:\n\u2022 Hands-on experience building with LLMs, with a strong intuition for what models can do and how to get the best results out of them.\n\u2022 Well-crafted (i.e. generally reliable; tastefully designed) work examples.\n\u2022 Self-direction and motivation: you repeatedly, independently seek out the most valuable thing you could be doing, and start working on it. You do so even when requirements and priorities may be changing rapidly.\n\u2022 Decisive, clear communication on both technical and strategic matters: at this stage, you'll be helping build the foundations of our company. You should have ideas/opinions about almost everything we do, and you should be forthcoming with your thoughts (even if it means being disagreeable).\n\u2022 Bonus points:\n\u2022 Experience working on parsers and compilers (e.g. LLVM; Typescript), type systems (e.g. Sorbet), or VSCode or IntelliJ itself.\n\u2022 Experience with search and/or indexing technologies.\n\u2022 If you've previously worked at a startup, or founded one yourself.\n\nCompensation:\n\nDepending on the relevance and amount of your experience, the salary for this position ranges from $1,700 to $2,500 per week.",

    "description": "Hi, we're The Browser Company \ud83d\udc4b and we're building a better way to use the internet.\n\nBrowsers are unique in that they are one of the only pieces of software that you share with your parents as well as your kids. Which makes sense, they're our doorway to the most important things \u2014 through them we socialize with loved ones, work on our passion projects, and explore our curiosities. But on their own, they don\u2019t actually do a whole lot, they\u2019re kind of just there. They don\u2019t help us organize our messy lives or make it easier to compose our ideas. We believe that the browser could do so much more \u2014 it can empower and support the amazing things we do on the internet. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building one: a browser that can help us grow, create, and stay curious.\n\nTo accomplish this lofty task, we\u2019re building a diverse team of people from different backgrounds and experiences. This isn\u2019t optional, it\u2019s crucial to our mission, as we need a wide range of perspectives to challenge our assumptions and shape our browser through a bold, creative lens. With that in mind, we especially encourage women, people of color, and others from historically marginalized groups to apply.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nAbout the Team: At The Browser Company, we've taken a unique approach to building our Swift/Chromium web browsers for multiple platforms. While most major browsers are written in C++, we decided to avoid challenges around slow iteration speed and memory safety by building Arc and Dia using Swift. A small team of language compiler and systems engineers, led by Saleem Abdulrasool, have implemented the protocol that allows us to run our Swift code across MacOS, Windows, iOS and Android.\n\nAs a Compiler Engineer at The Browser Company, you will focus on advancing Windows support for Swift and developing new features that benefit both our internal projects and the broader Swift community. Your work will directly contribute to our efforts to redefine how browsers and cross-platform applications are built, leveraging Swift as a core part of our technology stack. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to work closely with open-source communities while solving complex technical challenges that have a tangible impact on the future of software development.\n\nOverall you will...\n\u2022 Enhance Compiler Performance: Investigate and address performance bottlenecks, focusing on areas like memory allocation, PGO/LTO/BOLT, and hot function optimizations. Collaborate with cross-functional teams to improve build times and developer productivity.\n\u2022 Platform Support: Maintain and expand support for multiple operating systems, including Windows and Android. This includes enabling CI testing, debugging tools, and profiling capabilities to ensure robust toolchain performance. Maintain and improve support for multiple architectures including X86_64 and ARM64 across different Operating Systems. Be involved in emerging architecture support as well (e.g. RISCV).\n\u2022 Toolchain Development: Build and maintain custom toolchains on macOS and Windows, ensuring seamless integration with tools like Xcode and VSCode. Develop deployment solutions for alternative toolchains to enhance developer workflows. Work to support new platforms for cross-compilation and improve existing ones across the compilation pipeline.\n\u2022 Cross-Language Interoperability: Drive innovations in Swift and C/C++, Java/Kotlin interoperability, enabling seamless integration for Windows and Android application development. Improve Swift\u2019s interoperability with C and C++ codebases to improve developer experiences with multi-lingual codebases.\n\u2022 Collaborate with Open Source Communities: Contribute to upstream LLVM, Swift, and related projects, ensuring alignment with industry standards and fostering innovation.\n\nAfter 1 month you will...\n\u2022 Onboard onto our team and codebase with your onboarding buddy\n\u2022 Attend a number of onboarding presentations on the company, product, codebase, and culture\n\u2022 Get familiar with Swift, our Windows toolchain and tooling, and our Windows roadmap\n\u2022 Ship a few bug fixes and small improvements across our codebase and tooling\n\u2022 Pair programmed with a few people on the engineering team\n\u2022 Be regularly posting product feedback about the browser in our #dogfooding channel\n\nAfter 3 months you will...\n\u2022 Be familiar with our Windows architecture, and be thinking of ways to make product engineers' lives easier when prototyping and building new features.\n\u2022 Be familiar with our Windows toolchain, our Swift bindings, and how the Swift compiler works on Windows\n\u2022 Shipped several tickets to improve Swift language features and Swift developer tooling\n\u2022 Be involved in weekly engineering discussions about our architecture, how we do code review, code style, and more.\n\u2022 Be involved in infrastructure discussions like how we add better observability to debug issues in production, how we better monitor performance regressions, and how we make our updater less finicky.\n\nAfter 6 months you will...\n\u2022 Be interview trained and interviewing candidates for roles at The Browser Company.\n\u2022 Be driving projects from conception to production launch.\n\u2022 Be mentoring and pair programming with newer engineers to help them get spun up on the codebase.\n\nQualifications\n\u2022 Compiler experience. You have 4+ years of experience working with language compilers and complex codebases, such as LLVM. Ideally, you\u2019ve worked with Swift and/or C++.\n\u2022 Operating system experience. Some familiarity with one of our operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS) is preferred, but not required.\n\u2022 A passion for build systems and tooling. You understand how to improve systems to make them easier to understand, debug, and maintain. You're excited about elegant, maintainable, and easy to use build tooling and configuration.\n\u2022 Pragmatism and problem-solving. You\u2019re pragmatic, motivated by nebulous problems, and excited to work in a startup environment with quick product validation cycles.\n\u2022 You\u2019re time zone overlaps with our team. We\u2019re primarily focused on hiring in North American time zones and require that folks have at least 4+ hours of overlap time with team members in Eastern Time Zone.\n\nCompensation\n\nThis is a part-time independent contractor (1099) position. Compensation for this role is $120-190 per hour dependent on experience. For contractors, there is the potential to convert to full-time.\n\nThe Browser Company is a well-funded, ambitious startup of close to 100 people (and growing!) who are passionate about building great products. We are a remote-first, distributed team, with the option to work from office in Brooklyn, New York. We strongly support diversity and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.\n\n\ud83d\ude99 To read more about what we value as a company, check out Notes on Roadtrips on our blog.",

Those are Dreams Worth Chasing.\n\nAt Sierra Space we envision a future where humanity lives and works in space, on moons, and on distant planets. Our mission isn\u2019t restricted to the few, instead we see a future where all people can choose to live, work, discover and explore beyond our planet. Our company is building a platform in space to benefit life on Earth and together we will alter the course of humanity.\n\nWe have a bold mission. We are a bold company. Together, we are an extraordinary team.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nDo you enjoy developing new products and services? Join us! Our Software Engineers work in an agile, collective environment. You will be using your skills and expertise to define, design, develop, test, certify and improve cutting-edge software products. These cover a very wide range from advanced mission payloads and electronic systems through highly integrated aircraft to orbital and space exploration systems. You\u2019ll perform coding, debugging, testing, and troubleshooting of systems and software throughout our development process. Your technical duties involve the design and development of new software products throughout the product lifecycle.\n\nSierra Space\u2019s Defense division focuses on the design, build, and operations of small satellites in support of commercial services and national security space.\n\nAs a Flight Software Engineer, your primary responsibility will be designing and developing flight software and algorithms solutions for spacecraft missions for both civilian and DoD applications. These designs stem from understanding, analyzing and evaluating satellite and constellation capabilities, mission concepts, and system requirements. Your work will ensure we meet customer requirements by making data-driven decisions in architecting, implementing and testing the design in a testbed prototype and subsequent delivery of the flight code. Along the way, you will contribute to analyses of various architectures that include space vehicles, satellites, sensors, communications, and ground infrastructure; evolving or creating new approaches based on analysis results. You will also contribute to evaluating the mission effectiveness of the candidate approaches, balancing mission objectives against factors such as development and lifecycle costs.\n\nThe Software Engineer participates in all portions of the software life cycle (concept development, requirements definition, design, development, testing, and deployment) of flight software to support ongoing and future small satellite programs. This individual must have a strong working knowledge of object-oriented design using C++ and must have a strong background in developing flight code on embedded processors. The ideal candidate will have recent experience with at least one real-time operating system (such as VxWorks) and be familiar with both asymmetric and symmetric multiprocessing architectures.

    "description": "About Abridge\n\nAbridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most\u2014their patients.\n\nOur enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.\n\nWe are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense. We have offices located in the SoHo neighborhood of New York, the Mission District in San Francisco, and Lawrenceville in Pittsburgh.\nThe Role\n\nWe\u2019re looking for Software Engineering Interns to join Abridge\u2019s San Francisco Internship cohort for a 10-12 week program. In this role, you\u2019ll collaborate with our experienced software engineering team to build and ship real-world product features using a modern web stack (primarily in Typescript). With mentorship and guidance, you\u2019ll gain hands-on experience designing, coding, and releasing software that makes a meaningful impact to making clinicians\u2019 lives easier.\nWhat You'll Do\n\u2022 Design and build end-to-end features, enhancing our existing systems to add new functionality.\n\u2022 Fix user-facing bugs and issues and make quality-of-life improvements to the codebase.\n\u2022 Develop a strong user-centric mindset, building empathy for Abridge\u2019s clinicians and the challenges they face.\n\u2022 Collaborate across our cross-functional product teams, working closely with design, product, machine learning, and infrastructure to ship features to our customers.\n\u2022 Receive guidance from an experienced software engineering mentor as well as collaborate one-on-one with teammates within your pod.\n\nWhat We\u2019re Looking For\n\u2022 Experience with Typescript, React, and Node.js or Next.js.\n\u2022 Prior hands-on experience developing web applications (e.g., internship, co-op, or personal projects).\n\u2022 A strong interest in pursuing a full-time software engineering role in 2026\u2014high-performing interns are eligible to receive a return offer.\n\u2022 A curious, adaptable, and proactive mindset, with a desire to learn and grow in a fast-paced startup environment.\n\u2022 A willingness to pitch in wherever needed\u2014we move fast, and we need team players who are eager to contribute.\n\nBase Salary: $40 / hr\n\nMust be willing to work from our San Francisco office at least 3x per week\n\nThis internship is based in our San Francisco office. To support relocation, Abridge will cover flights to and from San Francisco at the start and end of the program. Rent and living expenses will be factored into the internship salary package.\n\nWe value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you\u2019re interested in the role but aren\u2019t sure whether or not you\u2019re a good fit, we\u2019d still like to hear from you.\nWhy work at Abridge?\n\nAt Abridge, we\u2019re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the \u201cinverse\u201d way in a legacy system\u2014focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.\n\nAbridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds\u2014an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it\u2019s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.\nHow we take care of Abridgers:\n\u2022 Generous Time Off: 13 paid holidays, flexible PTO for salaried employees, and accrued time off for hourly employees.\n\u2022 Comprehensive Health Plans: Medical, Dental, and Vision plans for all full-time employees. Abridge covers 100% of the premium for you and 75% for dependents. If you choose a HSA-eligible plan, Abridge also makes monthly contributions to your HSA.\n\u2022 Paid Parental Leave: 16 weeks paid parental leave for all full-time employees.\n\u2022 401k and Matching: Contribution matching to help invest in your future.\n\u2022 Pre-tax Benefits: Access to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Commuter Benefits.\n\u2022 Learning and Development Budget: Yearly contributions for coaching, courses, workshops, conferences, and more.\n\u2022 Sabbatical Leave: 30 days of paid Sabbatical Leave after 5 years of employment.\n\u2022 Compensation and Equity: Competitive compensation and equity grants for full time employees.\n\u2022 ... and much more!\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\nAbridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).\nStaying safe - Protect yourself from recruitment fraud\n\nWe are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions.",

We make simple, effective software for complex problems. Our software Studyrandomizer.com is used worldwide by e.g. the University of Oxford (UK), Yale University (US), the University of Sydney (AU). Our software is used for: Covid research, finding a treatment for Parkinson's disease, sleep research and many other use cases. Our software is web based, and uses a combination of node, vue, APIs, html, and SQL databases.\nWe\u2019re self-funded, profitable, and sustainable. When you work with us, you get a stable and predictable long-running engagement, in a low-stress environment.\nYou have expertise in Node, APIs (OpenAPI), and SQL. Everything else is a nice-to-have, and can be picked up on the job.\n\nYour first project:We have a codebase in Flask/Python that we need to port to Express/Node with OpenAPI. The project uses Postgres as a database.\n\nAbout the engagement:Fully remote. Work in a place you prefer. Most of the work can be done async. However you need to be available with approximately 4 hour overlap during UTC+2 office hours for sync work. We'll sometimes do video calls to discuss code and work together, but most of the time you'll work on your own. We're flexible on the day you want to work, and on the office hours.\nInitially about 2 days/week (64-80 hours/month), with occasional additional days according to our needs. You need to be available for occasional video calls, and we are flexible regarding the scheduling. You'll work together with the main developer in improving code and building new things.\n6 month engagement, moving to an ongoing commitment if both sides are satisfied with the initial engagement. There is a chance of increasing the monthly hours in the future, but this is not something we can promise.\nThe engagement will be a contractor engagement, and you are responsible for your own taxes and insurance.\nWe welcome applications from within and outside of the EU.\nThings you\u2019ll do:\nRegularly update dependencies\nFix bugs\nDevelop with OpenAPI and other APIs\nWrite tests, e.g. E2E tests\nMake sure our code is secure, e.g. dive into OAuth\nCode new features and improve existing features\nClean up the existing code\nDiscuss, decide, and implement new technology with us: currently we're looking into a distributed db, and a queue system.\nOur tech stack:\nNode 16\nExpress and Atlassian Connect Express\nVue, looking into Quasar\nPostgres and SQLite\nS3\nmany APIs\nHeroku and Scalingo for hosting, and we will add other hosting providers soon.\n\nTools we use:\nEmail - the preferred way to communicate\nGit, gitlab - for version control and issues\nGitpod for online editing (WIP)\nNextcloud\nOrgmode - for task management. We probably move to something else soon.\nEmacs, however we're open to your favourite editor.\nSlack and Video - because sometimes synchronous communication is necessary.\n\nAbout us:We\u2019re a small, fully remote team, mostly in Europe. Our company is based in the Netherlands.\n\nOur attitude:\nKeep things simple: this goes for our product, our processes, and our code base.\nGet things done: finish tasks, test and integrate before starting the next thing.\nWork in a low-stress environment: We get our work done, but without unrealistic, strict deadlines and without undue pressure.\n\nAbout you:\nYou are smart and get things done.\nYou speak good English.\nYou have solid experience in Node, APIs and SQL. Some experience with vue is a plus.\nYou are able to demonstrate past work.\nYou enjoy learning new technologies.\nThe time zone where you live is within +/- 4 hours of Central European Standard Time.\n\nThe hiring process:\n\nApplications close 21 November, 2022\nHow to apply: Please send an email with your application to \"jobs@phaselockedsoftware.com\". The email subject line should read: \"Application for Fullstack JavaScript Developer contract\"\nPlease tell us why you think you are a good fit for the job.\nInclude your CV. It should show significant experience in Node and SQL.

From Dashboard, our customers can control their entire Meraki stack: access points, switches, firewalls, client devices, cameras, and more. You will work across the stack with other developers, UX designers, and product management to build and improve the Dashboard web application. Meraki engineers put the customer experience first, own projects from beginning to end, and are empowered to make impactful decisions.\n\nMeraki believes that the quality of our product is dependent on the quality of our engineers. We place a high value on nurturing the growth and development of everyone on our team. We foster an open and supportive workplace where everybody is given the opportunity to succeed.\n\nExample projects of an Intern:\n\u2022 Create services to fetch data from millions of Meraki devices, then present that data in a user-friendly way\n\u2022 Improve performance and efficiency of our backend, allowing us to handle increasingly large datasets with minimal delay\n\u2022 Build internal frameworks and refine front end infrastructure to augment developer productivity\n\u2022 Construct API endpoints to allow Meraki users and third party companies to build custom tools and features\n\u2022 Build a dashboard for anomaly / outlier detection on network traffic using machine learning algorithms\n\u2022 Build a graph for network traffic analysis using clustering and other algorithms\n\nYou are an outstanding applicant if:\n\u2022 You are pursuing a technical degree or have equivalent experience with a strong foundation in the fundamentals of computer science\n\u2022 You strive to build rich and dynamic web applications with front-end frameworks such as React, Redux, Ember, or Angular\n\u2022 You are familiar with programming languages and web frameworks like Ruby (Rails, EventMachine), Python (Django, Flask), or Node.js (Express)\n\u2022 You have worked with SQL and relational Databases\n\u2022 You would flourish within a small engineering team and are excited to tackle open-ended problems\n\nIntern Program Overview:\n\nMeraki interns and co-ops join the team for 12 and 16 week programs, respectively, and are placed directly onto subteams. During the program, interns/co-ops have the opportunity to work on a small starter project, such as integration and implementation of new tools, before spending the majority of the program on a larger project, such as building the infrastructure for a new service. Projects are cross functional, which allow insight into new languages and technologies, help encourage professional growth within engineering, and allow a sense of ownership within the team.\n\nMeraki's engineering teams place a high emphasis on mentorship. Each intern and co-op is matched 1:1 with a mentor who provides continual feedback and guidance throughout the duration of the program. Mentors help with introductions to other team members, overviews of tools and processes, and provide a seamless integration into Meraki life.\n\nIntern Benefits:\n\u2022 Housing Assistance in San Francisco for duration of program\n\u2022 Competitive salary\n\u2022 Weekly social events inside and outside of the office (Giants games, Exploratorium tickets, friendly soccer games)\n\u2022 Lunch and dinner daily\n\u2022 Customized laptop and desk setups\n\u2022 Medical coverage plan\n\nCisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis.

    "description": "Job title: Full Stack Software Engineer - Application Development\n\nCompany: Palantir Technologies\n\nJob description: A World-Changing Company\n\nPalantir builds the world's leading software for data-driven decisions and operations. By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nPalantir Foundry is an end-to-end platform for data-driven decision-making. We're transforming the way organizations securely integrate their data, so they can then build reliable, critical applications atop that unified foundation. Our customers use Foundry to perform rich analyses that drive core operations within their organizations. They can also build sophisticated, full-fledged programs such as common operating pictures, alert-triaging inboxes, and resource allocation planning tools driven by rich-ML models.\n\nAs a Full Stack Engineer focused on application development in Foundry, you will be responsible for crafting the tools used by thousands of users to build the sophisticated applications that power their businesses. You will be architecting and developing interfaces to make sophisticated, data-intensive workflows both powerful and approachable, including to non-technical users. You may spend one day interviewing users to better understand their needs and identifying product gaps to improve. The next day, you might find yourself putting that customer context to use and brainstorming how to handle intricate UX needs with your teammates. You'll regularly be faced with sophisticated technical problems, requiring you to scope out the solution design and finding an incremental path to shipping the new features. As part of this, you will own APIs and schemas that power your frontend code, or work with other backend engineers in developing them together.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nWe're hiring engineers who are passionate about solving real-world problems and empowering both customer app builders and end-users to do their work optimally. Some examples of the types of product work you'd get to do are:\n\u2022 Designing and building for high-scale data intensive APIs (example)\n\u2022 Developing interactive workflow UIs\n\u2022 Building products which aim to make technical concepts accessible for non-technical users\n\u2022 Creating low-code/no-code WYSIWYG tools, which enable application builders within Foundry to build products for their users (example) arise the role and its primary responsibilities in narrative form\n\nTechnologies We Use\n\u2022 Typescript and React are central to our front-end development.\n\u2022 Blueprint as a re-usable front end component library.\n\u2022 A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand.\n\u2022 Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, GitHub, and CircleCI.\n\nWhat We Value\n\u2022 Passion for building user interfaces that enable users to tackle their problems.\n\u2022 Ability to understand how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building.\n\u2022 Ability to work optimally in teams of technical and non-technical individuals\n\u2022 Skill and comfort working in a constantly evolving environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.\n\u2022 Experience brainstorming and iterating with product designers.\n\u2022 Experience building high-quality software in a fast-paced CI/CD development environment\n\u2022 Proven ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.\n\u2022 Ability to learn new technology and concepts, even without in-depth experience. Motivated by unlocking or improving user workflows while still maintaining engineering quality.\n\u2022 Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance is beneficial but not necessary.\n\nWhat We Require\n\u2022 List the requirements that need to be met to be considered for the role. These are objective, non-comparative, and can be clearly identified through a resume. Examples include:\n\u2022 2+ years of frontend software engineering experience, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics.\n\u2022 Strong front end coding skills. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we're looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in JavaScript and an understanding of how web technologies work.\n\u2022 Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.\n\u2022 Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, or similar languages.\n\u2022 Strong written and verbal communication skills\n\nOur benefits aim to promote health and wellbeing across all areas of Palantirians' lives. We work to continuously improve our offerings and listen to our community as we design and update them. The list below details our available benefits and some of the perks that can be enjoyed as an employee of Palantir Technologies.\n\nBenefits\n\u2022 Medical, dental, and vision insurance\n\u2022 Life and disability coverage\n\u2022 Paid leave for new parents and emergency back-up care for all parents\n\u2022 Family planning support, including fertility, adoption, and surrogacy assistance\n\u2022 Stipend to help with expenses that come with a new child\n\u2022 Commuter benefits\n\u2022 Relocation assistance\n\u2022 Unlimited paid time off\n\u2022 2 weeks paid time off built into the end of each year\n\nSalary\n\nThe starting salary for this position is estimated to be $120,000 year. Total compensation includes approximately $30,000/year of equity compensation in the form of Restricted Stock Units, based on the recent value of the company's stock at the time of grant.

We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world's hardest problems.\n\nPalantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone.
